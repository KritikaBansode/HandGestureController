# HandGestureController

## 📌 Project Description
The **Hand Gesture Controller** is an innovative application designed to allow users to control PowerPoint presentations through hand gestures. Users can upload their PowerPoint files to the app and navigate through the slides using predefined gestures. This project leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and recognize hand gestures, providing a seamless and interactive presentation experience.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload PowerPoint files and present directly from the app.
- Control presentation slides using hand gestures (e.g., swipe left/right to navigate, fist to stop).
- User-friendly interface for uploading and managing presentations.
- Real-time hand gesture recognition with high accuracy.
- Cross-platform compatibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Streamlit (for user interface)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for gesture recognition model)
- AWS (for deployment)
